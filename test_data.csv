to help with relief efforts in new york and washington , d . c . , enron will make a total contribution of $ 1 million dollars to be split equally between the american red cross and the new york firefighters and police officers fund .
many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and i want you to be aware of some of the options available . i encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts , and to take advantage of our matching gift program to double the impact of your individual donation . because of the significance of this tragic event , enron will match your contribution 2 for 1 .
how to help
? please go to www . easymatch . com / enron . once there , click on "" disaster relief "" ( located in the middle of the top of the page ) . please choose from the list of non - profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort . any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $ 15 , 000 matching gift limit . you will need your gis number to do this ( it begins with a 9 ) . if you are unsure of your gis number , please contact the hr gim helpdesk at 713 - 853 - 5666 .

dear friend ,
permit me to inform you of my desire of going into
business relationship with you .
i am mr andy monga , the only son of late mr and mrs
banabas monga . my father was a very wealthy cocoa
merchant in abidjan , the economic capital of ivory
coast , my father was poisoned to death by his business
associates in one of their outings on a business trip .
my mother died when i was a baby and since then , my
father took me so special . before the death of my
father on january 2002 in a private hospital here in
abidjan , he secretly called me on his bedside and told
me that he has the sum of eighteen million , five
hundred
thousand us dollars ( us $ 18 , 500 , 000 ) left in a fixed /
suspense account in one of the prime banks here in
abidjan , that he used my name as his only son for the
next of kin in depositing the fund . he also
explained to me that it was because of this wealth
that he was poisoned by his business associates . that
i should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where i will transfer this money and use it for
investment purpose such as real estate management or
hotel management .
i am honourably seeking your assistance in the
following ways :
1 ) to serve as a guardian of this fund since i am only
20 years old
2 ) to make arrangement for me to come over to your
country to further my education and to secure a
resident permit for me in your country .
moreover , i am willing to offer you 15 % of the
total sum as compensation for your effort / input after
the successful transfer of this fund into your
nominated account overseas and 5 % for expenses .
furthermore , you indicate your options towards
assisting me as i believe that this transaction would
be concluded within ( 24 ) days you signify
interest to assist me .
anticipating to hear from you soon .
thanks and god bless !

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
"" bean - counter "" and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,
sharon

"Subject: neon september 13
hey guys and girls ,
?
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth .
?
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know .
?
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders :
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly ,
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly ,
their expectations will ultimately be met .
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times .
?
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !
?

"Subject: enronoptions - your stock option program
it is amazing and yet not surprising how much enron has accomplished in the
first six months of this year . you continue to make it happen . we recognize
that you work hard every day to accomplish enron  , s business goals , and we are
pleased that many of you have shared in the company  , s financial success
through enron stock options .
as you may know , the current employee stock option program ( also known as the
all employee stock option program or aesop ) began in 1994 and provided value
to participants through 2000 . employees who have participated in this
program from its inception have realized a 1 , 119 % increase in the value of
their stock options ( assuming a stock price of $ 70 ) over the life of the
program .
enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package
and a contributing factor to your performance and to enron  , s continued
success . therefore , the enron executive committee and the compensation and
management development committee of the enron board of directors have decided
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package .
on may 1 , 2000 , the committee approved an employee stock option program for
calendar years 2001 - 2005 ( enronoptions  ) your stock option program ) . it is
expected that enronoptions  ) your stock option program will be granted ,
effective on or about december 29 , 2000 , for those employees who are eligible
on that date ( please see note below ) . the new program , which is subject to
final approval by enron  , s board of directors , is as follows :
? enronoptions  ) your stock option program will give stock options to
eligible full - time and part - time regular employees in domestic and
international companies / locations .
? the grant of non - qualified stock options will equal 25 % of annual base
salary ( 5 % of annual base salary for each year of a 5 - year period ) on
december 29 , 2000 . ( salary calculation and value may vary in some
international locations . )
? the board will grant the stock options on december 29 , 2000 .
? eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant
of stock options .
why commit your talent and energy to enron ? enronoptions  ) your stock option
program , among other good reasons  ( that  , s why .
in the coming weeks , you will be receiving more details about enronoptions  )
your stock option program . to provide information and answer your questions ,
we will introduce a special link on the human resources web - site , host
several espeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular
basis . in the meantime , if you have immediate questions , please contact your
human resources representative .
note : in addition to final approval by enron  , s board of directors , granting
of options will be subject to new york stock exchange and state and federal
regulatory requirements . it is expected that enronoptions  ) your stock
option program will be available to most enron employees ; however , some enron
companies  , employees may not be eligible due to legal , accounting , tax , labor
or business issues . as you know , enron changes to meet the needs of the
marketplaces we serve . given that need to change , we will continue to refine
the eligibility for enronoptions  ) your stock option program and will
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being
determined on december 29 , 2000 .",0

hplc currently has a gas purchase agreement ( global # 96014987 ) in place with
calpine that extends through 5 / 31 / 2001 . sitara deal no . 133259 correctly has
this contract attached to it . effective 11 / 1 / 1998 the contract was amended

"Subject: personal contact
dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .
before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .
the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .
it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .
i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .
i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .
you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .
thank for your anticipated co - operations .
peter stevens .

10 , 000 should be allocated to adonis # 51862 on the 5 th only . nothing should
be allocated or confirmed for adonis on the 16 th . additionally , it looks
like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from mitchell ( track id 3167 ) on the

jackie ,
what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more

kowloon , hong kong .
reply destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
i am mr . srichai pope , credit officer of win hang bank ltd . i have an urgent and
very
confidential business proposition for you .
on august 6 , 1999 , a british consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals
corporation , mr . philip brian a british citizen made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit
for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty - eight million
dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent aroutine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply .
after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers , the hong kong solid minerals corporation that mr . philip brian died from
a boat mishap . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a
will , and all attempts totrace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made
further investigation and discovered that mr . philip brian did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my
bank . this sum of us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever
come forward to claim it . according to laws of hong kong , at the expiration of 5
( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the hong kong
government if nobody applies to claim the fund .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the
next of kin to mr . philip brian so that the fruits of this old man ' s labor will not get
into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple , i will like you to
provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of
kin .
the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65 % for me
and 30 % for you and 5 % for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction .
there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the
attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction .
if you are interested , please reply immediately to my e - mail
box . destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction . please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication . you should
observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply .
sincerely
mr . srichai pope .

"Subject: record sales , profits , earnings , stock price and trading for leth jylra
market mover stock report ' s last pick ( cwtd ) exploded from $ 1 . 19 to
$ 9 . 20 , a gain of over 670 % in 5 days ( feb 12 - 17 ) ! ! !
here is our next hot pick which we feel is the most undervalued stock
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year based
on their sales figures ( incl . a backlog of over $ 100 million ) , incredibly solid
numbers , and low outstanding share total .
life energy and technology holdings , inc .
( otcbb : leth )
current price : 2 . 45
near - term target : 7 . 00
projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year
while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom
line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into
electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market .
( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update :
leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to
procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of
an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months .
solving a dual crisis - waste and energy :
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere
process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of
waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the
global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process
converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal
solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial
wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of
used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news
leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit
of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to
receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months .
the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock
above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry
pe of 18 - 22 .
examining leth - by the numbers
total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets
cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash
shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million
shares retired in feb . ' 04
additional shares to be retired : 1 . 3 million per company press release
estimated shares in float : 7 million
completed biosphere process systems now in operation : 26
record backlog of sales for leth :
during the past year , over 20 additional biosphere process systems have
been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over
$ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these contractual agreements
include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the
future once the initial order has been completed . the options vary from
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this
low - float , emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $ 7 million
per biosphere process system !
leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system :
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and
electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government
with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of
necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the
biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of
obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the
biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for
leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana
while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -
term announcement .
stock set to explode on earnings boom :
leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to
achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s
breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released
batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very
big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global
demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches
unprecedented levels .

gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas
requirements
down to essentially zero ( it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down )

3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5

the lengthening is permanent !

"Subject: re : path manager rewrite / optimization project
since lisa used fuchsia , i ' ll use lavender . .
on # 1 i would eliminate that processing . in addition , can we delete / hide / not access old paths that haven ' t been used in gas production in lets say a year or so . would this help performance ? this would also force the schedulers to path / think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate ! ! we ' ve seen old bad , zero paths be re - used accidentally .
on # 2 , the scheduling position window is the weakest link . . . . . goodbye !
on # 3 , contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list . nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments . do we need it in the inventory list ? probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it ' s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts .
on # 4 , we use this functionality alot on cgas , tenn , trco and sab . . . when we path one to many or many to one in "" chunks , "" it does seem to go faster than one path at a time .
on # 5 , brokered paths could really just be slammed in there . no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .
thanks

subject : path manager rewrite / optimization project
importance : high
all :
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .
the sooner we get someone to devote to this , the better off we will be . i expect these changes that we ' ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit .
that being said , we ' ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager .
1 ) currently , the path manager attempts to reuse path ids . i can ' t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step ? it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .
2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .",0

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .

in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we

oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers

revenue and becoming a cash - fiow positive leader in major oil - producing

eogi ' s high - yieiding , muitiple driiling programs have been solidified

i have no problem sticking around with the group , it is a compliment and i am glad that you all appreciate what i have been able to contribute to the group . i just want your opinion on something .
one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that .

darren :
here is my problem . as you know , hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude . the problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude . bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc , ena and egm that would book the deal correctly . julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february , except for one small part , but march forward was never completed . the attached word document explains the procedure . basically , we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price . this would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo . then , we would book a sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - wellhead for the value of the gas only ( no volume ) and a sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude ( no volume ) . for these deals , we would use demand fees . egm will pay ena for the crude dollars .
i will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move . you will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo . julie zeroed this out , but o ' neal put it back . i ' ve left him a message to find out why .
1 . sale from hplc - im wellhead to tglo 547201
2 . sale from hplc - im hplc to hplc - im wellhead 547205

here is a preliminary list of what needs to be done to finish out the transactions for march , april and may . the previous email went to kam keiser , john grass , linda roberts and dayem khandker . they may be able to help us work through this . let me know if you have any questions .

feb 2001 591307
march 2001 640685

2 . enter a ticket for the hpl - wellhead sale to ena - wellhead for march , april and may 2001 ( the feb deal number is 679848 ) for the value of the gas below . this should be entered as a demand fee only , no volume .
march 2001 $ 774 , 612 . 50
april 2001 $ 705 , 870 . 00
may 2001 $ 664 , 609 . 00

"Subject: february surveys
hello ,
we are starting to prepare the february data for our model . please provide a
completed "" hours "" survey for each position within your group . this survey
will collect the the time your team spent on performing their activities in
the month of february .
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labeled "" select your rc "" .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message "" select
position from drop box ! "" you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and "" ok "" . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity
listed in the column labeled "" hours "" .
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .
if you do not , the information will be lost .
we have included january compiled hours per position ( if you had two
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the "" last month ""
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you
perform not included in your survey , please contact me as soon as possible
for a copy of the activity dictionary .
please return these surveys by end of day friday , march 3 rd . if this is a
problem , please notify immediately .
thanks ,

"Subject: hpl meter # 985579
gary :
hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1 / 1 / 99 thru 6 / 99 . prior to
1 / 1 / 99 , ena was purchasing some of the volumes from i p petroleum under
contract # 016 - 44386 - 102 ; deal # 341832 . this deal expired 12 / 31 / 99 , but the
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to i p petroleum by pioneer .
since there was no deal to cover these volumes , these volumes were allocated
to hpl strangers gas contract .
volume mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from
someone , but never received one .
here are the months and volumes that need resolution :
prod . mth mmbtus
jan . 99 6 , 510
feb . 99 6 , 395
mar . 99 14 , 789
apr . 99 16 , 866
may . 99 8 , 415
jun . 99 13 , 858
total 66 , 833
possible solution :
1 . need a deal to cover the periods in question , or
2 . provide authorization to writeoff the volumes . ( print & return original
to clem cernosek )
approval to writeoff the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
ps : my understanding is that neither i p petroleum nor pioneer have
addressed any issues concerning these volumes .",0

look thru the sequence history . the meter # on the opposite side did not change
even though the pipe code did . that is all i have to suggest .

"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state .",0

we wish to be happier than other people and this is difficult , for we believe others to be happier than they are . claret is the liquor for boys port for men but he who aspires to be a hero must drink brandy . winners must learn to relish change with the same enthusiasm and energy that we have resisted it in the past . to confess a fault freely is the next thing to being innocent of it .
communism has never come to power in a country that was not disrupted by war or corruption , or both .

we will burn that bridge when we come to it . life has a practice of living you , if you don ' t live it .
old age has deformities enough of its own . it should never add to them the deformity of vice .
beauty is the index of a larger fact than wisdom . pictures are for entertainment , messages should be delivered by western union . he was inordinately proud of england and he abused her incessantly .

"Subject: beaumont methanol - meter 1428 - october 2000
ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .
please call with questions .
thanks

i have smoked for 40 + years , and i quit cold turkey .
basically , i took final smoke , and a couple of hours later tried
to smoke a cigarette . but i was absolutely sick from it !
i now can keep up enjoy my grandchildren without coughing wheezing ! !
thank you ! ! ! - mary t . goddard , ks
this system works ! ! ! i ' ve wanted to quit smoking for some time now ,
but the physical cravings always kept me back ; but with this system ,
my cravings were gone , and now so is my awful habit ! ! - kai e . clinton , ny

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

clarissa - thanks so much for all your help with this pipe ! everything looks great . i just have a couple of paths
that i need to finish it :
january 2000 - i need deal # 854688 pathed for epgt and for tetc . according to the invoice , we should have
11 , 129 dth on the interconnect .
february 2000 - i need deal # 871184 pathed for hpl and chan . hpl should have 3 , 600 dth and chan should
have 11 , 500 dth on the interconnect .
july 2000 - deal # 871172 has an interconnect issue . according to mops contract # 105124 , they received 8 , 275 dth
on the matagorda 624 , but according to epgt , they delivered 10 , 362 dth to hpl ( ? ) could this possibly
need to be split somehow , or do you have any other ideas ?
let me know . thanks , gloria 3 - 7118",0

"Subject: monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm

global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

we were buying gas from the houston exploration company on black marlin , high island 138 / hpl meter 98663 , deal 508426 . the deal was priced at hsc - 0 . 14 . in december , a new platform came on , high island 115 / hpl meter 986431 . it did not start flowing until the 20 th . danny did not put a new deal in for this meter , so we combined the gas on deal 508426 . the houston exploration thinks that the gas at hi 115 should be kept separate and priced at hsc gd - 0 . 14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20 th . we agree that we received the gas . we have the pipeline statement from black marlin . we just don ' t have the same pricing . the houston exploration shows that we owe them an additional $ 222 k due to this price difference . we only purchased this gas in dec 2000 and jan 2001 . the deal for jan , 547063 , was priced at gd - 0 . 14 . can you verify how this deal should be priced ? i sent this issue to danny back in january and he said the if price was correct , but the houston exploration is sticking to their price . if you need to talk to their trader , his name is lester lipperdt 713 - 830 - 6960 .

"Subject: fw : the odds are against them
there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda
needs . i am confused about praxair though .
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number

"Subject: fw : section 311
just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case .
- - - - - original message - - - - -
from : hull , bryan
sent : tuesday , august 14 , 2001 7 : 16 am
to : redmond , brian
subject : fw : section 311
brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . .
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .",0

after getting your imput , i think this is the best :
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a

better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be
different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization

subject : re : cell phones
the latest is that if they want to keep their phones , they need to fill out a contract changing the liability to them .
we will have some in our office tomorrow around 1 ( ran out today ) and they can also pick one up at a cingular store . just make sure that they mail them back to me .
my home address is : 4501 shetland houston 77027
as for the cancellation of the corporate phones , that is not scheduled to take place yet , and may not right away .
if they just want to do a rate plan change , then they can do it via email ( have them email me ) or they can indicate it on their contract that they fill out to change liability .
the main thing to do is to fill out the contract to change liability , which also obligates them for one year .
as for the balances accrued up to date , they are not responsible for those . enron is .
good luck to you . i hope you get my email and i hope i get to see you again .
and , yes , i will be getting all new accounts now !

hi ! any word yet about the cell phones ? i ' m getting nervous , as are a lot of others , i ' m sure . some people in my group are really wanting to keep their phones , and they are asking me questions that i don ' t know the answers to . . . like what kinds of rate changes there will be , as well as to what point will the liability be theirs , and how far back will they have to pay to get the invoices current , if enron has not done so already .
how are you affected by this ? will cingular find another business that you will work out of ? just curious .

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,

subject : monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

as i mentioned to you yesterday , it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert ' s origination fee deducted . do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery ?
also isn ' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo ? is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting ?
darren
do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct ?

i reviewed the gas deals on franks ' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in sitara . as soon as i have the october gas numbers , i will forward them to you .
attached is a spreadsheet of the tglo deals booked to the gl to help you with our current settlement position . it is divided by debit / credit entries . when the sales are booked , a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account ( 40004000 third party ; 40005000 intercompany ) for the profit center .
below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to egm . i have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book aug and sept crude . i will wait for the go ahead from frank before i final them to the gl . let me know if you have any questions .

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

subject : tribute to america
subject : tribute to america
i needed to read this in light of yesterday ' s events . . . . .
tribute to the united states
this , from a canadian newspaper , is worth sharing .
america : the good neighbor .
widespread but only partial news coverage was given
recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
toronto by gordon sinclair , a canadian television
commentator . what follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional
record :
"" this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
americans as the most generous and possibly the
least appreciated people on all the earth . germany ,
japan and , to a lesser extent , britain and italy
were lifted out of the debris of war by the
americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts .
none of these countries is today paying even the
interest on its remaining debts to the united
states . when france was in danger of collapsing in
1956 , it was the americans who propped it up , and
their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of paris . i was there . i saw it .
when earthquakes hit distant cities , it is the
united states that hurries in to help . this spring ,
59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes .
nobody helped . the marshall plan and the truman
policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
countries . now newspapers in those countries are
writing about the decadent , warmongering americans .
i ' d like to see just one of those countries that is
gloating over the erosion of the united states
dollar build its own airplane . does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
boeing jumbo jet , the lockheed tri - star , or the
douglas dcl 0 ?
if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the
international lines except russia fly american
planes ? why does no other land on earth even
consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you
talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .
you talk about german technocracy , and you get
automobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,
and you find men on the moon - not once , but several
times - and safely home again .
you talk about scandals , and the americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued
and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most
of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are
getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to
spend here .
when the railways of france , germany and india were
breaking down through age , it was the americans who
rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the
new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an
old caboose . both are still broke .
i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced
to the help of other people in trouble . can you name
me even one time when someone else raced to the
americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was
outside help even during the san francisco
earthquake .
our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one
canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around . they will come out of this thing
with their flag high . and when they do , they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada
is not one of those . ""
stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !
this is one of the best editorials that i have ever
read regarding the united states . it is nice that
one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of
the world would realize it . we are always blamed for
everything , and never even get a thank you for the
things we do .
i would hope that each of you would send this to as
many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am
just a single american that has read this , tribute to
the united states

"Subject: big cowboy - additional production
tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big
cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase
this gas at "" hpl meters "" at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been
pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes
have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom
and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and
determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im
wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu
tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective
april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .
please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .

"Subject: channel a / s line maintenance

this is a reduction in total capacity from 528 , 000 to 400 , 000 at station 809 .
hpl has typically been running about 180 , 000 to 200 , 000 mmbtu through station
809 in august . we can pull more gas off of the a - s line at swan lake to keep
our throughput around the 175 , 000 .
my original conversation with epfs was that the capacity would be limited to
around 400 , 000 mmbtu total during the maintenance . station 809 will be down
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move
without 809 running . i will visit with epfs on monday and see if we can get
the volume bumped up ( to 400 , 000 ) and adjust on tuesday as necessary .
if you have any questions please call . 36449 .

"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization - revised
revision in bold . pass on to any who may need this .
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a deal for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent . the agent
contract will get cleared . re - select the agent contract .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the pipeline contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .

subject : sitara eol bridge problem today
the problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets ( 2098073 , 2099764 ) not having startdate and enddate . missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up . ( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .
the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .

on day 5 in mops ( hpl / ena ) there is a delivery nom of 10 . 0 pathed to the ena
201 k . on day 16 in mops ( hpl / ena ) there is not a deal ( which is strange
because day 16 in pops references adonis ) . the deal on the 5 th was a swing

jackie ,
what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0

the noms . ces use to have transco do it for them and so did we for january
and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we
are , they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you
will have better luck than i did .

"Subject: zero path termination in path manager
matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .
all :
please respond via e - mail with any comments .

from actual press releases : yjycunv
red bank , n . j . , aug 24 , 2004 ( primezone
via comtex ) - - the following is a letter from john
figliolini , president of atlantis business development
corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf
dear shareholder , addlrko
i am writing to you today to
discuss the new direction which your company will be
heading . up until this point we made it clear that
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
the market . our basic premise was to seek out
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
businesses with the proper equity investment made into
them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;
with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
various projects they are currently working on .
e - direct is another example ; we should start to see
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has
not maintained a particular industry focus . as of
today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
last week we announced that abdv
will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to
future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,
a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start
of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in
locating and provide managerial , accounting and
financing for companies in the energy field , from oil
and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
you may ask ; why the energy
related field ? simply it currently offers many
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
to be made in this sector . according to adjusted
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis
of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem
to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand
for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this
year alone , most of which is because of china . the
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30
level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented
in stone . there are more players in the world economy
today that require oil gas to propel their own
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself
with individuals that have experience in the energy
field . these individuals will help locate viable
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira
so what do we do with our
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
until they are at a level where they can move on their
own . i believe that both of these companies will be
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at
that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the
basic premise of our business module whereby we share
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
public our portfolio companies . we can then continue
to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw
by concentrating on a specific
sector such as the energy area we will be able to
define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our
goal will be to locate and make investments in no less
than four energy - related businesses over the next 12
months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an
investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative
way to participate in the booming oil gas and
energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm

imbalances :
i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our
payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand .
again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but
things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this
imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ?
i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions :
how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ?
can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to
keith once we get the ar issue solved ?
where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ?
where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ?
duke energy 206 is still a problem .
do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large
number to me , can we net some of them ?
are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex
contract ?
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have
the right to use .
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf
energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ?
can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .
gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this
contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some
where we are owed ?
is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ?
where did the exxon imbalance come from ?
do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ?
can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ?
what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon ,
how old is this imbalnce ?
mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to
translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ?
i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can
we resolve this ?
i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to
have to work on a better way to check our positions .
i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james
mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with
the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we
need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .",0

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david
gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a
pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in
1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with
another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas ,
they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at
that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have
been connected with the lord  @ s work in croatia for all these years . before
leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they
raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado
springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and
david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now
i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a
biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday .
dragica and i believe god listens and hears ? prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,

i have a request from the ena settlements group . williams energy is billing
the hpl purchase deals on the ena invoice . the accountant at williams says ,
that by the request of the hpl trader , the deals are to be billed to ena . we
would like to have the texas deals billed directly to hpl . if you do not
have a problem with this , can you ask your counterpart at williams to split
the deals between hpl and ena ? it would make the payment process much easier .

"Subject: spinaker / n . padre island block 883 : allocations
per our various discussions , i am sending an email to reiterate the
disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this
time , the general land office is transporting their share of production
( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % .
the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september
1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl
purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had
both deals moved to 9862 . the meter should probably be designated a
callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after
the production month by volume management .
for october production forward , i am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter
to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their
percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any
large balance swings on their agreement .
anita : for september , i need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket
379424 ; hpl gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . please unallocate the transport
and purchase at 9848 . the meter is a daily swing right now . let me know
when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology .
i apologize for the length of this email , i want to make sure that we are all
on the same page , to the extent that we need to be , prior to this deal
getting too far down the road . please do not hesitate to call me if you have

re : transfer of us $ 48 . 223 million { forty eight million two hundred
twenty three thousand u . s dollars only } to your account . [ strictly
confidential ]
i feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business having
gone through your remarkable profile on the internet . though , this
medium ( internet ) has been greatly abused , i choose to reach you through
it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication . however ,
this correspondence is unofficial and private , and it should be treated as
such .
at first i will like to assure you that this transaction is 100 % risk
and trouble free to both parties .
my name is dr . collumbus walter from , i work as the operational manager
in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one
of the prime banks here in south africa . on a routine inspection i
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a balance of
us $ 48 , 223 , 000 . 00 ( forty eight million two hundred and twenty three
thousand u . s dollar ) . on further discreet investigation , i also discovered
that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal
auto - accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person
knows about this account . i am in close contact with the manager of the
bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to
any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because
the former operator of the a / c is a foreigner and from australia in
particular . i am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral will
attached to the account , no beneficiary and nobody will come again for
the claim of this money .
it is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to
the account holder which i will provide to you if you are interested ,
therefore i need your cooperation in this transaction . the difference in
country
of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction . this
money will remain useless in this dormant account if i did not transfer
the fund out to a foreign account .
i will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order
to claim this money . i only need your cooperation as a foreigner to
provide your safe bank account information for the transfer . all
arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account
which you are to nominate is already in place . you should also provide me
with your direct phone lines for easy communication . i wish for utmost
confidentiality in handling this transaction .
at the conclussion of this transaction , your share will be 25 % of the
total transfer sum , 70 % for me and my partner while 5 % will be set
aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the
transfer .
the fund will be transferred to your account in two parts . i will
first transfer usd 20 million to your account . i will fly over to meet you
after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed
percentages . i will have the remaining balance of usd 28 , 223 million
transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the first
transfer without any disappointment from your side .
have a nice day as i entrust this transfer into your hands .
let me hear from you urgently .

mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in
place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .",0

daren - -
i know you ' re busy with bid week , so here are a couple questions & comments
for you :
september
i need to know if a ticket has been set up for september for the market side
of the williams & apache gas . we still only the supply is in mops . if it
just needs points added to it , just let me know the deal ticket # .
august 31 st
this was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on
lonestar 1023 & 1460 . currently , they do not have the supply points needed
for the williams & apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to
imbalance . . . so i will get them added so this gas can be pathed .
july 31 - aug 7
these days were pathed as buy / sells from tenaska iv to tenaska marketing
ventures .
i worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment ( july &
aug business ) , and had them do a manual entry for aug 31 st .
please let me know what you think when you get a chance .

"Subject: re : coastal deal - with exxon participation under the project
agreement
thanks for the info !
as greg mentioned in the staff meeting today , the intent is that this
restructured deal is papered effective 4 / 1 / 00 . the impact is potentially
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate
transport / gathering agreements , etc . if any rates are changing , then those
need to be changed in our systems also . there may be other areas of changes
also - i ' m not attempting to list them all . rather i just want to make
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations .

finalize the new gathering arrangment between hpl and coastal , the revenue
sharing arrangement between exxon and hpl ( transaction agreement ) and the
residue gas purchase agreement between coastal , as seller and hpl as buyer
( amendment to wellhead purchase agreeement ) .
i do not have a copy of the processing agreement between exxon and coastal ,
as such agreement does not involve us ( and i believe it is far from
finalized . the only other document that i plan to prepare is a termination

changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to
assignment )
fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

conoco has nominated 5 . 0 / d at this meter . conoco transport can be allocated
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
exceed 5 . 0 mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter .

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .

arre you saying that for both days that two ( 2 ) ena contracts should be
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the
total volume to each contract ?
to : jackie young / hou / ect @ ect
cc : rita wynne / hou / ect @ ect
subject : re : enerfin meter 980439 for 10 / 00
jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the
interconnect report .

jackie ,
your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because
we have tiered pricing this month .

"Subject: marketing services / scheduling
daren ,
thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling
the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a
strong case could be made in favor of that idea .
it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,
nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge
base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue .
if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market
intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and
pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services
immensely .
as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and
more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .
i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to
handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to
think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only
person that should be involved in the industrials .
i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you
and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat
that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite
alright .
once again , thanks for listening .

subject : glo / egm gas / crude swap
george - i ' ve done some t - accounts ( the bean counter in me ) and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward :
change the existing deals , 547201 and 591307 , to a zero price . this will eliminate the a / r balance on hpl ' s books for glo , but will keep the volume nom ' d to glo and will not impact ua 4 .
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets . this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $ 974 , 144 for 1 / 01 and $ 766 , 304 for 2 / 01 .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl . the amounts would be the same as in # 2 above .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month . for 1 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 886 , 638 . 60 ( the 12 / 00 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . for 2 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 839 , 008 . 29 ( the 1 / 01 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) .
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward :
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly .
the demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out .
the demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm .
once this is done , the a / r balance for glo will be cleared , the margin will be on the ena wellhead book , and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl . this needs to be done monthly prior to flash , which will prevent any oa variances . the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month , and since the volume is firm , there shouldn ' t be a problem calculating the value . we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm . if you have any questions or see a better way to do this , please let me know . thanks .

howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,

we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

brenda ,
as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get
the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price . can the

sorry it took me so long to get back to you . pg & e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
reduced shrinkage , 19 . 000 mmbtu / d , and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $ 0 . 04 .
pg & e did not have the right to do that , so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock , from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index . at the same time pg & e will create an imbalance , for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days . this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc ( the price in the comstock purchase contract )
and selling it at the gas daily price for 12 / 12 and 12 / 13 . the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out .

sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal i have attached below .
apparently we bot from pge industrial on the 12 th and 13 th . pg & e has
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco , and claim that they are
net deals . i do not show a sale in the system at the meter , and i checked
the 215 k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco , perhaps at
another meter , and could not find one .
any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated .

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .

vessels in your penis to relax which allows the blood flow into your penis . the result is
the improved erectile function . cialis will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction .

let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?

"Subject: netco items
wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a "" final or startup "" list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .",0

landon had made an unsuccessful attempt at the recitation , and the doctor ,
somewhat nettled , said : landon , you don ' t seem to be getting on very fast in
this subject . you seem to lack ambition . why , at your age alexander the
great had conquered half the world . yes , said landon , he couldn ' t help it ,
for you will recall the fact , doctor , that alexander the great had aristotle
for a teacher .
on the first day of college , the dean addressed the students , pointing out
some of the rules : the female dormitory will be out - of - bounds for all male
students , and the male dormitory to the female students . anybody caught
breaking this rule will be fined $ 20 the first time . he continued : anybody
caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $ 60 . being caught a
third time will incur a hefty fine of $ 180 . are there any questions ? ! ! ! ! at
this point , a male student in the crowd inquired : how much for a season

"Subject: tenaska iv agency fee
can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 .
my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further .

per conversation with rosa brown and thu ( in volumes management , beaumont methanol is a swing deal , by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr . thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428 .
do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter # 981428 ? if so , can you confirm 02 - 01 sales ( on hpl , meter # 981428 . , sales deal # 603107 ) , to beaumont methanol ( which we ' ve invoiced them ) , vs . chyral hankins ' e - mial to buddy majorwitz below ? the only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02 - 13 - 01 ( she reflects noms of 0 vs . the 3 , 811 mmbtu that we invoiced them ) .

"Subject: big cowboy - additional production
tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at "" hpl meters "" at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .
please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or information to add .

daren ,
sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

"Subject: cheap soft cialis tabs
these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

"Subject: this week ' s woodworking tip . . . follow - up
good afternoon !
no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this
morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them
along .
kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :
he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding
the problem .
before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of
your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to
see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep
this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .
another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment
gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !
a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips .
talk to you again in a few weeks .

subject : fw : crm database
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : crm database
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :
1 . account & contact management
2 . activity tracking & planning
3 . potential deal management
4 . outlook synchronization
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :
industrial mkts freight mkts
users 175 45
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000
activities 1 , 200 900
quotes 150
opportunities 361 11
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :
eol
global mkts
ees
transportation
east power orig
insolvent debt
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?

the contract ( 96007529 ) should have expired under ena , but because of the timing of the expiration , it got "" assigned "" to aep / hpl ( 96060798 ) . therefore , for informational / historical purposes , i extended the term under 96060798 thru 5 / 31 / 01 .
someone from linda ' s group will have to extend the term under the original contract in order for the deal to be attached .

i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig
ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i
forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of
contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper
scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we
be kept in the loop , especially on retroactive deals , as scheduling ,
transport rates and risk are affected .

elgin
is in the process of merging with jonpol to create a company with substantial
platinum interests and near - term production potential .
the combined company will have in excess of 12 million
ounces of platinum group metals to its credit , all in the measured and
indicated resource category . most importantly , both of the main deposits that
will initially be held by the new company are presently headed toward early
development .
both of elgins projects are on the eastern limb of
the bushveld complex in south africa . the bushveld is the worlds most
important source of platinum , producing two thirds of the world ' s supply of the
precious metal .
the elgin deposits have grades and other attributes
comparable to nearby profitable operating mines . they have the added benefit of
being located at a shallow depth , with plans to begin mining one of the
deposits as an open pit . by taking advantage of nearby infrastructure , elgin can develop the mines quickly and at modest capital costs .

"Subject: dear friend ,
dear friend ,
i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe .
this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the
interest of the country .
it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum .
i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you .
all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets .
there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country .
we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers .
i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction .
i shall furnish you with more details on request .
yours truly

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

"Subject: announcing outlook web access for houston outlook users
attention : houston - based outlook users
the global messaging team is proud to announce that beginning today , monday july 16 th , houston - based enron employees that have been migrated to outlook will be able to securely access their enron email from anywhere on the web . this means that if you can get on to the internet , you can access your enron email with outlook web access ( owa ) without having to dial in to enron ' s network . please note that this is not available to those users still on lotus notes but will be available once they are migrated to outlook .
once on the internet , type mail . enron . com in your browser address window and supply your enron network logon credentials as username and password . for example :
username : jdoe 4
password : * * * * * * * *
once you log in , outlook web access opens your enron email mailbox . outlook web access ( owa ) allows you to send and receive mail , perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts , as well as access your mailbox folders . at this time , public folders are not accessible via owa . please keep in mind that outlook web access is a browser - based version of what you might use in the office , so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of outlook 2000 may not be available at all . additionally , owa is only supported using internet explorer 5 . x only and not supported with netscape .
outlook web access is the standard email package for connecting to your enron mail from home , whether you are using an enron - issued home pc , an internet connection with your personal home pc , or your clickathome pc . we will not support the use of the full outlook installation for home use .
outlook web access for remote locations and european / apac enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon . at this time , owa is only available if your mailbox resides on a houston mail server .
if you have any questions , please call :

"Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 . - followup
here is a followup to the memo sent on 12 / 31 / 99 . fyi
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know . unresolved - appears to be unassigned ?
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . unresolved
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . unresolved
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january . resolved but needs to be verified .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated . unresolved or unpathed ?
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? unresolved
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
i haven ' t had time to do this yet . if we haven ' t figured out the assignement
then i will get to it asap .",0

christina ,
the attached shows the volumes that should have been nominated effective
6 / 15 / 00 and 6 / 16 / 00 . the sea robin plant was back up for those two days and
gas was processed resulting in a decrease for pvr . effective 6 / 17 / 00 , the
plant was down again and volumes were increased to reflect no processing
loss . i forwarded those volumes to you on friday , june 16 .
let me know of any questions you have .
thanks ,
steve
